TSMLC is a library client designed to facilitate how you interact with the MLC blockchain.

## Why TypeScript

  * TypeScript is is a superset of JavaScript which mainly offers optional static typing, classes, and interfaces. The learning curve is not that steep.
  * Types are optional, TSMLC compiles into ES5 so you can work with both, ECMAScript or TypeScript.
  * A better development experience, including auto-complete and fully documented.

## Documentation

> [API documentation](https://ockhamconsulting.github.io/mlc-ts/) is hosted on github pages, and is generated from [TypeDoc](https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc).

## Installation

TSMLC is avaliable from `npm`.

```bash
yarn add mlc-ts
```

or

```bash
npm i mlc-ts --save
```

## Usage

For the best TypeScript experience, you should either use [Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com/), or a [plug-in for your favorite text editor](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/TypeScript-Editor-Support).

### Basic Examples

> Get delegate list from Devnet network.

```js
import { Client, Network, NetworkType } from 'mlc-ts';

const devnet = Network.getDefault(NetworkType.Devnet);
const client = new Client(devnet);

client.delegate.list().subscribe((list) => {
  console.log(list);
});
```

> Get address from passphrase.

```js
import { PrivateKey } from 'mlc-ts/core';

// if no specify a second param, default is mainnet
const key = PrivateKey.fromSeed('my secret passphrase');
console.log(key.getPublicKey().getAddress()); // AaWU6X3pGdtSCK3s9weo9tjth64F3hixgT
